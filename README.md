# RedditDataUtil
A simple reddit bot that follows a given subreddit, tracks changes in score, and outputs JSON data.

Note that this is a work in progress.


## Description
This project uses the Python Reddit API Wrapper (PRAW) and some other simple Python libraries to retrieve new posts from a given section of Reddit. It then tracks changes in the score of each post over time and outputs that data as JSON.

## Future Development
The long term plan is to use this to gather data about how successful posts perform over time. Eventually, this will be put into a "good" data set and used to train a machine learning model. The model will then make predictions about how successful a post will be.
