# RedditDataUtil
A simple Reddit data utility that pulls post information from a given subreddit and returns a csv file.


## Description
This project uses the Python Reddit API Wrapper (PRAW) to retrieve data from a given section of Reddit. The utility will output a csv file with the following fields: Post title, post author, serious tag, time of day, day of week, upvote count, comment count, sum of first level comment scores, elapsed time since posted, and title word count. Once outputted, the data can be used for analytics.

## Future Development
This data utility is part of a larger project to predict popular Reddit posts using machine learning. This page will be updated as development of the project continues.
